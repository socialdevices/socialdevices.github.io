{"name":"Social Devices","tagline":"Collaborative Co-located Interactions in a Mobile Cloud","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\nSocial Devices is a concept developed jointly by [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi) and [Tampere University of Technology](http://www.tut.fi) as part of the [Cloud Software Program](http://www.cloudsoftwareprogram.org), the Towards a Mobile Cloud activity in the [Computing in the Cloud](http://www.eitictlabs.eu/innovation-areas/computing-in-the-cloud/) activity line of [EIT ICT Labs](http://www.eitictlabs.eu), and the [Co-Located User Interaction with Social Mobile Devices](http://www.cs.tut.fi/ihte/projects/CoSMo/) (CoSMo) project funded by the Academy of Finland.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Social Devices aims at enriching various kinds of co-located interactions between people using proactive context-sensing devices. Currently, there exist various services for supporting remote social interactions between people. However, we believe that it is important to also support the face-to-face, co-located interactions between people. The concept of Social Devices combines research from different areas, such as mobile computing, service-oriented computing, pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and social theory.\r\n\r\nTo realize the concept of Social Devices, a number of different challenges related to service composition, device coordination, context-awareness, proximity detection, and human-computer interaction need to be overcome. Therefore, to test the concept of Social Devices in practice, we have developed a prototype implementation called the Social Devices Platform (SDP). The SDP implements the basic requirements of Social Devices and provides a platform for studying and developing more advanced concepts related to, e.g., the self-adaptation of services in a mobile device cloud. The SDP also enables us to study how people feel about proactively initiated interactions.\r\n\r\n## People\r\n\r\n| Name | Contact information |\r\n| -----| ------------------- |\r\n| Mikko Raatikainen | Researcher, Project Manager<br>Aalto University, SoberIT<br>mikko.raatikainen@aalto.fi |\r\n| Tommi Mikkonen | Professor<br>Tampere University of Technology<br>tommi.mikkonen@tut.fi |\r\n| Tomi Männistö | Professor<br>University of Helsinki<br>tomi.mannisto@cs.helsinki.fi |\r\n| Timo Aaltonen | Researcher<br>Tampere University of Technology<br>timo.aaltonen@tut.fi |\r\n| Varvana Myllärniemi | Researcher<br>Aalto University, SoberIT<br>varvana.myllarniemi@aalto.fi |\r\n| Niko Mäkitalo | Doctoral Candidate<br>Tampere University of Technology<br>niko.makitalo@tut.fi |\r\n| Jari Pääkkö | Doctoral Candidate<br>Aalto University, SoberIT<br>jari.paakko@aalto.fi |\r\n| Mikko Ylikangas | Research Assistant<br>Aalto University, SoberIT<br>mikko.ylikangas@soberit.hut.fi |\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\n(last updated 18.6.2013)\r\n\r\nK.
